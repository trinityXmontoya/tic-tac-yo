# tic-tac-yo

command-line tic-tac-toe game. my submission to Recurse Center

## Options to Run
1. use [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)
2. execute the attached jar -> `java -jar tic-tac-yo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar`

### Notes
I intentionally chose to leave this simple (user cannot choose between playing as X or O, the program exits when the game is over, and I did not break it into separate files / namespaces as I would have if this was production code) :)

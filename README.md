# tic-tac-yo

command-line tic-tac-toe game. my submission to Recurse Center

### Notes
I intentionally chose to leave this simple (user cannot choose between playing as X or O, the program exits when the game is over, and I did not break it into separate files / namespaces as I would have if this was production code) :)
